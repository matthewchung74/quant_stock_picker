# Quantitative Stock Analysis Agent

A financial analysis tool that uses specialized AI agents and real-time market data to perform comprehensive analysis of stocks for trading strategy development, supporting both long and short positions.

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
2. Clone this repository
3. Create your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
4. Configure your environment:
   - Edit the `.env` file with your API keys (see "Required API Keys" section below)
   - Set `BACKTEST=true` in `.env` if you want to run in backtest mode
5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

The application will automatically:
- Build with all required dependencies
- Mount your local directory for easy development
- Create necessary directories (journal, logs, output)
- Start running with your configuration
- Run in backtest mode if BACKTEST=true in your .env file

To stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Required API Keys

The following keys need to be configured in your `.env` file:

- **DEEPSEEK_API_KEY** (required): For the DeepSeek AI model
- **ALPACA_API_KEY_LLM_AGENT** and **ALPACA_API_SECRET_LLM_AGENT**: For market data access and trading execution
- **ALPACA_PAPER_TRADING_LLM_AGENT**: Set to "true" to use paper trading (recommended)
- **POLYGON_API_KEY**: For real-time and historical market data
- **TAVILY_API_KEY** (optional): For enhanced news search when DuckDuckGo has rate limits or fails

Additional configuration options:
- **BACKTEST**: Set to "true" to run in backtest mode
- **ALPACA_BASE_URL**: API endpoint (defaults to paper trading URL)

## Overview

This application uses a multi-agent architecture powered by DeepSeek AI, combined with Alpaca Markets financial data APIs. Each aspect of stock analysis is handled by a dedicated specialized agent:

1. üìà **Market Data Agent** - Retrieves and analyzes current financial data, including:
   - Real-time price data and recent price changes
   - Technical indicators (RSI, SMA-50, SMA-200, VWAP)
   - Support and resistance levels
   - Volume analysis and patterns
   - Short interest and borrowing metrics

2. üì∞ **Sentiment Analysis Agent** - Evaluates market sentiment through:
   - Recent news articles and their impact (using DuckDuckGo with Tavily fallback)
   - Social media sentiment trends
   - Analyst ratings and price targets
   - Institutional investor positioning
   - Short seller activity and bearish sentiment

3. üåê **Macro-Economic Analysis Agent** - Assesses the broader economic context:
   - Economic indicators impact (interest rates, inflation, etc.)
   - Geopolitical factors and their market implications
   - Industry trends and sector rotation
   - Short-specific macroeconomic factors
   - Key risks and opportunities in the current environment

4. üìä **Strategy Development Agent** - Creates comprehensive trading strategies:
   - Long positions (buying with expectation of price increase)
   - Short positions (selling borrowed shares with expectation of price decrease)
   - Specific entry points, stop-loss levels, and profit targets for both strategies
   - Position-specific metrics (borrowing costs for shorts, etc.)

## Output and Results

After analysis completes, you will find:

1. **Journal Directory**: Contains CSV files with detailed trade records
   ```
